# Demonstration of the ASIC network-driver functionality

# This script fragment is sourced by /etc/init.d/network-driver.sh,
# which in turn executes the network_driver_init() function.

# A machine, or set of common machines, can use this feature to run
# any scripts needed to perform the bulk of networking ASIC
# initialization and configuration.  A typical usage would be to
# initialize a common ASIC/SDK.

# The platform specific initialization is handled by the
# network-driver-platform script, which handles platform specific
# details like port/lane mappings.

# Use this function to initialize the networking ASIC and SDK.
