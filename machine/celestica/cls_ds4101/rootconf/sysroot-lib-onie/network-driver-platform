# Demonstration of the platform specific network-driver functionality

# This script fragment is sourced by /etc/init.d/network-driver.sh,
# which in turn executes the network_driver_platform_pre_init() and
# network_driver_platform_post_init() functions.

# A machine can use this feature to run any scripts needed by the
# machine to configure the networking ASIC for the platform.  A
# typical usage would be to initialize the ASIC for a specific
# platform port layout.

# Use this function to perform any initialization that are required
# to happen *before* the primary network ASIC initialization.
network_driver_platform_pre_init()
{
    echo "network_driver: Running demonstration pre_init routines..."
}

# Use this function to perform any initialization that are required
# to happen *after* the primary network ASIC initialization.
network_driver_platform_post_init()
{
    echo "network_driver: Running demonstration post_init routines..."
